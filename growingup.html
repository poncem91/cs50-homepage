                        Early Years & High School<br>
                        <p>
                            I was born and raised in Lima, Peru. From a very young age I enjoyed discovering new things to do, more puzzles to solve, and new ways in which to express myself creatively.
                            <br>
                            Initially I went through a computer phase that stimulated my mind as a young child, however when I reached my teenagers years I left computers behind and focused my time and energy in the arts.
                            <br>
                            Music was my heaven at that age. I first taught myself how to play guitar and soon after I was composing my own songs and teaching myself how to play several other instruments in order to be able to record all the instruments required in my songs.
                            <br>
                            I named my "solo-band" <a href="https://soundcloud.com/huxleys">Huxleys</a>, released a self-produced EP and graduated High School with the prospect of studying music production at USC.

                            College Life<br>
                            <p>
                                And just like that, I started my college years at USC pursuing a career in music production... or so I thought.
                                <br>
                                After some weeks during my first semester, I began doubting my career and life choices. I still loved music but did not want to make a career out of it. On top of that I was feeling extremely nostalgic about home and lost as to what to do in life if not music.
                                <br>
                                I decided to finish up my first semester at USC and come back home to Peru while I figured out what to do next... after all, who has that much money to spend on an American college tuition when you don't even know what you want to get a degree in?
                                <br>
                                I enrolled in college in Lima and took my general requirement classes while I tried to make sense of my life choices. I ended up choosing to follow another creative avenue and pursue a career in Media and Film. At this point I felt ready to go back to school to USC and finish my degree.

                            Post-Grad Years<br>
                            <p>
                                During my last semester at USC and shortly after graduating - I spent my time as an intern for talent management and production companies within the entertainment industry. Eventually, a few months after graduation I began my first real job as an Executive Assistant at Silver Lining Entertainment
                                <br>
                                My first year there was great! I learned a lot about the entertainment industry and felt I was doing something I loved... however by the second year, the novelty of it all had worn off and I felt my brain going numb.
                                <br>
                                I lacked mental stimulation and motivation to keep going.
                                <br>
                                I persisted through another year, thinking things would change, but the truth was that I reached a plateau that didn't fit my personality. I was eager to keep learning new things and creatively solve new challenges, and I wasn't in the right environment for that.
                                <br>
                                I wanted to be a part of technological innovations.
