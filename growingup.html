                        Early Years & High School<br>
                        <p>
                            I was born and raised in Lima, Peru. From a very young age I enjoyed discovering new things to do, more puzzles to solve, and new ways in which to express myself creatively.
                            <br>
                            Initially I went through a computer phase that stimulated my mind as a young child, however when I reached my teenagers years I left computers behind and focused my time and energy in the arts.
                            <br>
                            Music was my heaven at that age. I first taught myself how to play guitar and soon after I was composing my own songs and teaching myself how to play several other instruments in order to be able to record all the instruments required in my songs.
                            <br>
                            I named my "solo-band" <a href="https://soundcloud.com/huxleys">Huxleys</a>, released a self-produced EP and graduated High School with the prospect of studying music production at USC.

                        <a href="https://soundcloud.com/huxleys"><img src="huxleys.png" alt="Huxleys EP" class="img-fluid contentpics"></a>
                        <br>
                    <ol start="2">
                        <li class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase">
                            College Life<br>
                            <p>
                                And just like that, I started my college years at USC thinking I wanted to pursue a career in music production... but I quickly realized that music was something I wanted to keep as a hobby.
                                <br>
                                Confused about what I wanted to study, I declared a major in Communication, thinking it was a broad option that would allow me a wide variety of career options.
                                <br>
                                Towards the end of my time in college, I knew I was interrested in Technology and Media, but I was still unsure in exactly what capacity, but given that I lived in Los Angeles, the entertainment industry seemed like a good option.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase">
                            Post-Grad Years<br>
                            <p>
                                Shortly after graduation I began my first real job as an Executive Assistant at Silver Lining Entertainment, a talent management company that worked with actors and actresses.
                                <br>
                                My first year there was great! I learned a lot about the entertainment industry and felt I was doing something I loved... however by the second year, the novelty of it all had worn off and I felt my brain going numb.
                                <br>
                                I persisted through another year, thinking things would change, but the truth was that I reached a plateau and what I was doing didn't fit my personality. I was eager to keep learning new things and creatively solve puzzles and face new challenges, and I wasn't in the right environment for that.
                                <br>
                                I wanted to be a part of technological innovations and so my journey to learn programming began.
