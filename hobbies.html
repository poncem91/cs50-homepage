                            Snowboarding:
                            <p>
                                When I was going to college in Lima, I went abroad during my school summer break to work and learn how to ski/snowboard in Winter Park, Colorado.
                                <br>
                                It was also the first time I had lived in a place with so much nature, and I loved it so much that I returned the following year.
                                <br>
                                I've been snowboarding ever since and will jump at any chance to visit the snow.

                            Cooking:
                            <p>
                                I'm Peruvian so I was pretty much born with a passion for food.
                                <br>
                                In the last couple years, I've really enjoyed experimenting with recipes and understanding the science behind cooking and flavour.

                            Reading:
                            <p>
                                Ever since I can remember I've enjoyed reading, but reading definitely became a passion of mine when I started reading Harry Potter.
                                <br>
                                As a kid I used to devour books and would let them suck me into alternate worlds.
                                <br>
                                While I don't have as much time to read anymore as I used to when I was a kid, I try to listen to books on tape whenever I have free time, and maximize my time that way.
                                <br>
                                My latest favorite book is Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng.
