                            Snowboarding:
                            <p>
                                When I still lived in Lima, I went abroad during my school summer break to work and learn how to ski/snowboard in Winter Park, Colorado.
                                <br>
                                It was also the first time I had lived in a place with so much nature, and I loved it so much that I returned the following year.
                                <br>
                                I've been snowboarding ever since and will jump at any chance to visit the snow.

                            Cooking:
                            <p>
                                I'm Peruvian so I was pretty much born with a passion for food.
                                <br>
                                In the last couple years, I've really enjoyed experimenting with recipes and understanding the science behind cooking and flavour.

                                My latests cooking obsession is japanese ramen. For many months now, I've been trying to perfect a tonkotsu ramen bowl made from scratch (including the noodles!).

                            Tennis:
                            <p>
                                I first played tennis when I was 6 years old, but I didn't really enjoy playing it back then, so I stopped playing after a year or two.
                                <br>
                                Later on as a teenager I picked up tennis again and played sporadically, but it wasn't until my early 20's that I really developed a passion for the game.
                                <br>
                                Now I try to play tennis at least twice a week and will soon be participating in the Montana State Open.
